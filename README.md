# Web Scraping Basics with BeautifulSoup: Analyzing Oscar Award-Winning Films
The primary objective was to extract valuable insights from freely available online resources. I focused my attention on the subject of Oscar award-winning films, utilizing Wikipedia as a source of data. It's important to note that the web scraping conducted throughout this project was carried out in a legal and ethical manner, adhering strictly to the terms of use of the website. The website chosen for scraping had no security measures in place to prevent or discourage scraping activities, further aligning with the project's ethical framework.

For a more comprehensive understanding of the project's methodology, detailed explanations, and code snippets, please refer to the accompanying Jupyter Notebook in the project repository. The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step explanations of each phase, code snippets, visualizations, and discussions of the findings. It serves as an invaluable resource for anyone interested in learning about web scraping, data cleaning, and basic data analysis using Python.
